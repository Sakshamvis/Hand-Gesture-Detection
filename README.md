# Hand-Gesture-Detection
Real time Hand Sign Detection using MediaPipe and Machine learning 

This project implements a real-time hand gesture detection system using
MediaPipe for hand landmark extraction and a supervised machine learning
model for gesture classification. The system detects hand gestures from
a live webcam feed and displays the predicted gesture along with
confidence scores.

Features 
- Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam
- Custom data collection pipeline
- Hand landmark extraction using MediaPipe
- Supervised machine learning model (Random Forest)
- Gesture prediction with confidence percentage
- Modular and well-structured codebase
